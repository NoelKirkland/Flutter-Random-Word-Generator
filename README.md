## Description

This mobile application is my very first try with Flutter. I used a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gDhl4leEzA) to guide me. Flutter seems very intuitive and Dart feels very familiar, similar to JavaScript.

The application is simple. It uses a random word generator package to generate a never ending list of randomly generated word pairs. There are heart outline icons at the end of each row that, when pressed, turns red and the word pair is added to your favorites. See a list of all your favorited word pairs by clicking the navigator icon in the upper right corner of the screen.
