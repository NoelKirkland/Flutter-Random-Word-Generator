# WordPair Generator

#### A mobile application that will generate a list of random word pairs

#### By Noel R. Kirkland - 1/14/2021

## Description

This mobile application is my very first try with Flutter. I used a YouTube tutorial to guide me. Flutter seems very intuitive and Dart familiar and very similar to JavaScript.

The application is simple. It uses a random word generator package to generate a never ending list of randomly generated word pairs. There are heart outline icons at the end of each word row and, when pressed, turns red and the word pair is added to your favorites. You can be taken to secondary screen that is populated with all of your favorited word pairs by clicking the navigator icon in the upper right corner of the screen.
